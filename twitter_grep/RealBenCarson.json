Bringing 25K refugees to U.S. doesn't solve this crisis. Jordan already houses 1.4M refugees. We must do more. They need &amp; deserve our help.

"Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars.”—Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
I urge parents/guardians to please not allow your children to be exposed to the dangers of uncontrolled agitators on Baltimore's streets.
My thoughts and prayers to those who are experiencing fear and loss, including the families of Mr. Gray and first responders/officers.
The best way to create positive change is via peaceful conversation and policy ideas that display a commitment to resolution.
As a former resident of Baltimore, it is very sad and unfortunate to see the destruction taking place by irresponsible individuals.

Seal the border, and turn off the magnet by cracking down on employers who hire illegal immigrants.
We have plenty of laws on the books that demonstrate how someone becomes an American citizen. We don’t have to re-litigate that.
It’s time we start using common sense and show some guts.
I’m tired of the “comprehensive” approach to solving our problems, which results in 1000+ page bills full of confusion &amp; special interest.

I hope GOP Congress votes, on behalf of millions of #prolife men+women in both parties, to reaffirm their stated belief in protecting life
Perhaps someone can play the President's speech back to him &amp; maybe he will abide by the spirit of his words &amp; not that of his ideology.
Cooperation between the parties is needed and not multiple threats of vetoes.
Tax reform is needed but not redistribution.
The President's State of the Union address was uplifting, particularly if one is not aware of the actual facts.

I stand in solidarity with the people of France who are willing to stand up to the terrorist threats that impact freedom for everyone.
Let us also remember that freedom of press is a pivotal concept that we must continue to protect.
When will the world finally awaken to the brutality of this behavior?
The attack in Paris is a tragedy &amp; my sincere condolences to the families and the Gov. of Paris. We must reinforce our commitment to France.

In order for a divided government to work, each branch must respect the other two branches.

Over the past week we have opened 5 new reading rooms in Sacramento, California. Reading &amp; learning are the keys to success in our society.
I only hope that it will continue stimulating honest discussion bringing about true liberty in a nation thats for, of, and by We The People.
One year ago I was privileged to speak at the National Prayer Breakfast, having no idea that my speech would have such a dramatic impact.
Why do many go to great lengths demonizing the tea party just because they wish not to relinquish the power of the people to the government?
What the government does and what other people do is infinitesimally secondary to what effects we have on ourselves.

In 2014 there is a real opportunity to hold DC accountable and begin to craft some genuine common-sense reforms putting patients first.
Exciting news this week! I've just signed on as Chairman of the #SaveOurHealthcare Project with @AmerLegacyPAC. http://t.co/hSBMBDo3Eq
My career has been in medicine not politics but it doesn't take a brain surgeon to know Obamacare isn't working for all Americans. 
Our president displayed his flair for eloquent speech, perhaps less exciting to those desiring results as opposed to fancy rhetoric. #SOTU
Each of us individual citizens has more to do with our country's future than the political class that we elect and enable. #SOTU
I will be sharing some insights about my book "American the Beautiful" tonight at the Thunderbird Adventist Academy!
Until we include tort reform and a plan to reform health care we will not be successful.
Looking forward to meeting the wonderful bright young minds of Palm Beach Atlantic University this morning.

There would be no harm in developing relationships with those who oppose us, as this could eventually result in international harmony.
In the loom of the approaching SOCHI 2014 Olympic Games, we should be encouraging the Russians to work with our security forces.

We should never expect or predict a person's point-of-view based upon their race as that is truly the definition of racism.
As we celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. let us pay more attention to the content of one's character than the color of one's skin.
Today I will be speaking about my book, Gifted Hands, at @TheCrownCollege’s 20th Annual Faithful Men's Meeting in Powell, Tennessee.
The many delays caused by bureaucracy developing the energy sources in our nation resulted with more of an impact on the less affluent.
The many delays caused by bureaucracy in terms of developing energy sources resulted with more of an impact on the less affluent.
Theres a reason the President is Commander in Chief. In electing a president, their values must be consistent and of the highest standard.
Good Morning America! I'll be at the Tuckahoe Woman's Club in Richmond, VA today from 10:30am to 2pm and then again from 7:30pm to 9pm.
In the game of chess pawns are just used for the royal pieces. In real life the average citizen is similarly used by those in power.
Are we truly the captains of our destiny?

Our nation's founders placed so much emphasis on education that towns in Massachusetts could be fined for not providing adequate education.
2014 came in a blessing as my column is being distributed by renowned Creators Syndicate, adding an additional 200 newspapers across the US.
What was your most memorable moment of 2013?
Those who feel Obamacare is a save-all solution will soon discover that the number of hidden taxes and fees make it more than unaffordable.
Let's look forward to independent thinking and not blindly following others in 2014.
I hope that we all will remember that Christmas is a time of good cheer. In good spirit let us bring joy into the lives of those around us.
'Merry Xmas' is a salutation of good will.   Believing in Jesus Christ has nothing to do with accepting the joy of the season!
Is it important for people to be able to express their beliefs or rather more important to hide their beliefs in a facade of assimilation?
The wrangle of Phil Robertson of A&amp;E's Duck Dynasty is symptomatic in how society has migrated from the principles that founded our nation.
The constructive compromise on the part of both political parties must be supplanted with a winner-takes-all battle of wills.
Many brilliant people are not satisfied with being stuck in a position of automaton at the beckoning call of a nebulous bureaucrat.
Iran poses a severe threat to the stability of the Middle East and the World primarily because of it's ambition for nuclear advances.
Nelson Mandela was a hero able to put behind him grievances of violence and destruction &amp; become a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness.

With the uncertainty of our economy, those with resources must do all they can to support &amp; encourage young people who step out in faith.
If you're a good worker who is highly productive and become valuable, the employer would be foolish not to make every attempt to retain you.
Good Morning America! Had the pleasure of watching my Ravens prevail in what was the epitome of a nail-biter yesterday evening.
Nelson Mandela was a true hero and inspiration for my life. Thank God for allowing all of us to witness the life and times of Mr. Mandela.
The days of "sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me" are long gone as Americans have become hyper sensitize.
Its important for those in poverty to work hard, even with minimal wages they gain knowledge and skill that will allow for upward progress.
It is a strange how people deceive themselves, thinking that no one will unmask their dishonesty &amp; that they can hide in the crowd.
If we are dishonest, we cannot hide it for long. Amazingly, most of us have an uncanny ability to detect dishonest people.
When we act dishonestly, we cheat ourselves.
If we consciously decide to be honest, decent, clean, and not put skeletons in our closets, then we can concentrate on what we are doing.

Candy &amp; I are on our way to FedEx Field as guests of Dan Snyder to watch the Redskins battle the Giants.
I hope everyone has had a delightful Thanksgiving as this blessed day comes to a close. Make being thankful a habit and not a yearly ritual.
Sometimes giving our best and Thinking Big involves a great deal of risk.
RT @carsonscholars: Help us meet our #GivingTuesday goal this year: http://t.co/rFlRX4DUmb
When we act dishonestly, we must realize that it is only ourselves that we are cheating.
It doesn't matter where you're from. People who fail in life find lots of excuses. It's never too late to recognize the potential in oneself
If we commit ourselves to reading thus increasing our knowledge, only God limits how far we can go in this world.
Tune-in as I join Armstrong Williams live from his NY studios from 6-8 pm today on SiriusXM110 for a town hall on moving our country forward
It saddens me that influential people Oprah Winfrey would ever play the race card and deem those opposing the President's agenda as racist.
There is no such person as a self-made individual.
Yes, we need health care reform but it must not be imposed upon us by a government thinking it knows what is best for the American people.
Our Founding Fathers knew that is was imperative that we retain a well educated and informed nation.
The physically disabled possess gifts not readily apparent to everyone. We must treasure them in exerting compassion &amp; an utmost respect.
America surviving as a nation is dependent on being able to solve quadratic equations as opposed to the ability to sink a 25 ft jump shot.
One of the greatest harms to our health is repeated stress. Theres far less stress in honest lives than those filled with misdeeds and lies.
Detroit is but a harbinger of the fate that will befall our beloved nation if we don’t heed the warnings so vividly placed before us.
Having grown up in Detroit, I am particularly sad to see what has happened to a once-vibrant city that was the wealthiest in the nation.
Our current economy is toxic for growth. We must realize that our large federal debt will eventually spoil our future if we don’t act now.
…the brain can process two million bits of information per second. It remembers everything you've ever seen, everything you've ever heard…
Everyone in the world is worth being nice to. Because God never creates inferior human beings, each person deserves respect and dignity.
Knowledge strengthens one's power to overcome the past, to change our own situations, to fight new obstacles, &amp; to make better decisions.
Treating other people with kindness and love is my way of paying my debt to God and the world for the privilege of living on this planet.

Life is too short to make enemies of those disagreeing with you. We learn much more from those we disagree with than those we do agree with.

Marriage is a tremendous gift from God providing the security of a safe &amp; stable society to raise children; We must reclaim the honor in it.
Good Morning America! Make a pledge to @CarsonScholars and be sure to give on Dec. 3: http://t.co/ipDzoL4FYR #GivingTuesday
There has been a void in ethical world leadership, the US must step forward with offering effective and morally consistent policies.
"To compel a man to subsidize with his taxes the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves &amp; abhors is sinful &amp; tyrannical" - T. Jefferson
Entrepreneurship can only flourish in a realm of freedom &amp; free enterprise. Thats how America rose to the pinnacle of the world so quickly.
Unless we exercise our power of being 'We The People' of this nation by intelligently voting, we'll submit to an ever expanding government.
The ACA is oxymoronic, the time must come when we are collectively concerned for each other rather than what is advantageous for each other.
In living truthfully theres no need to recall what was previously said. The truth is always the truth &amp; adhering to it simplifies your life.
Political bullying is no different than school yard bullying. You must stand your ground, don't back down, and watch as it withers on.
Most bullies dont look for fights but just want to intimidate people into submission. Refusing to yield &amp; fighting back rids being targeted.
Ultimately our freedom stems from God. However we must thank the Veterans that have battled to secure &amp; maintain the freedom which we enjoy.
We celebrate and honor Veterans Day by honoring the many veterans that have died or were wounded in answering their call to duty &amp; service.
Please support &amp; make a pledge to @CarsonScholars and give on Dec. 3: http://t.co/ipDzoL4FYR #GivingTuesday
The founding father of our country believed in the God of the Bible, a man not only of tremendous intellect but of conscience and faith.
Of all the nations in the world &amp; of all the social experiments, there is no country I'd rather be a citizen of &amp; call home than America.
Among the many factors involved in our success was the conscious creation of an atmosphere conducive to innovation and hard work.
Can we learn from the mistakes of nations that preceded us &amp; take corrective active, or must we follow the same self-destructive course?
Excited to speak about the truth in leadership at the @alabamapolicy Annual Banquet this evening.
The United States of America is still the pinnacle nation in the world today. It is not, however, the first pinnacle nation to face decline.
America is an innovative nation. We must use our creative nature to provide adequate healthcare for everyone at a truly affordable price.
I'll be a panelist on Special Report w/ @BretBaier today live @ 6pm ET. We'll discuss issues relevant &amp; meaningful to the American people.
Kindness dictates that we abandon the pettiness stimulated by pride. We must remember that there are no perfect people, including ourselves.
If you treat obstacles as a containing fence they become excuses for failure. Treat them as hurdles, each one strengthens you for the next.
Success is determined not by whether or not you face obstacles, but by your reaction to them.
Looking forward to speaking about truth in leadership at @AlabamaPolicy Annual Banquet this week. We must again value virtuous leadership.
Admitting one is wrong requires a great deal of humility. A genuine leader can admit fault &amp; has the ability to learn from their mistakes.
My Ravens losing to the Browns yesterday saddened me. We must keep our spirits high and know that our beloved Baltimore will persevere.
In warm &amp; sunny Arizona today, ready to meet with smart people from across the country &amp; discuss protecting the livelihood of our Americans.
I will be guest speaking at the Alabama Policy Institute’s upcoming Annual Dinner this Thursday, November 7th.
Feel free to ignore those individuals who protest against anything reminding us of Judeo Christian heritage.
As the Holiday &amp; Christmas season approaches let us remember the spirit of gratitude &amp; charity towards others.
#Faith. Our country was founded on principles of faith.
Hopefully once the ACA website is running at capacity, many of the issues people are encountering will vanish for the sake of all Americans.
Get your ticket today and meet me in Nashville, TN on November 9th. The fundraiser event benefits @CarsonScholars: http://t.co/sbLiwu6SJL
Thomas Paine enormously impacted America with his Pamphlet "Common Sense", we can resurge by presenting logical solutions to the people.
It is extremly humbling and encouraging traveling from state to state &amp; seeing how many Americans have and celebrate common sense.
The Roman Empire was very, very much like us. They lost their moral core, their sense of values in terms of who they were.
People who spend every penny and borrow to spend even more have obviously never subscribed to the notion of saving for a rainy day.
If we acknowledge our need for God, he will help us.
Those who are quick to declare that we're living in a time of unique &amp; unprecedented risk are rid with a serious case of societal amnesia.
Come meet me on November 9 in Nashville at a fundraiser for @CarsonScholars: http://t.co/TwyMQCZtbO
If we commit ourselves to reading thus increasing our knowledge, only God limits how far we can go in this world.
We get out of life what we put into it. The way we treat others is the way we ourselves get treated.
Do your best and let God do the rest.
Rather than reacting to every risk we hear and see, we should make an effort to discern which ones we can actually do something about.
How are we to yield reasonable and wise decisions about the risks we face when our perspective on the subject is so often distorted?
Never make excuses when leadership fails, standup and be accountable.
The mark of exceptional leadership is the willingness to accept responsiblility, for both the triumphs and the defeats.
Through hard work, perseverance and a faith in God, you can live your dreams.
In our culture, security has become an obsession. We buy every kind of insurance to provide us with the security we think we need.
If we recognize our talents and use them appropriately, and choose a field that uses those talents, we will rise to the top of our field.
Anyone who can't learn from other's mistakes simply can't learn, that's all there is to it. There is value in the wrong way of doing things.
Successful people don't have fewer problems. They have determined that nothing will stop them from going forward.
The greatest strength of good governance is honesty. If the governing power can't be trusted, chaos ensues.
Happiness doesn't result from what we get, but from what we give.
Until next time Denver! I'm off to Seattle &amp; then LA for a Carson's Scholars fundraising event.
In order to right the ship, we need to return the responsibility for good health care to the patient and the health care provider.
Can we provide good health care for all of our citizens without turning over control of our most important possession to the government?
Come see Candy and me in Silver Springs, MD this Sunday at 2 pm http://t.co/Md3CQBnxXI  #booksigning.
