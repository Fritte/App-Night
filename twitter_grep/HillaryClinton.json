"It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes &amp; then also prevent them from ever finding new ones." ‚ÄîHillary
"Remember: many of these Syrian refugees are fleeing the same terrorists who threaten us." ‚ÄîHillary
"Turning away orphans, applying a religious test, discriminating against Muslims...that‚Äôs just not who we are. We‚Äôre better than that."
"We cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and our humanitarian obligations." ‚ÄîHillary
"We are in a contest of ideas against an ideology of hate‚Äîand we have to win." ‚ÄîHillary https://t.co/URx9h8eN87
"Repeating the specific words 'radical Islamic terrorism' is just a distraction...Our priority should be how to fight the enemy." ‚ÄîHillary
"Let‚Äôs be clear: Islam is not our adversary. Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism."
"This is a worldwide fight‚Äîand America must lead it." ‚ÄîHillary on defeating radical jihadism
"Our goal is not to deter or contain ISIS, but to defeat and destroy ISIS." ‚ÄîHillary
We "can‚Äôt sacrifice our values or turn our backs on those in need. We must choose resolve‚Äîand we must lead the world to meet this threat."

Hillary will fight to protect DACA/DAPA, pass comprehensive immigration reform, and keep families together. #DemDebate
Hillary will defend President Obama‚Äôs executive actions on immigration‚Äîand if Congress refuses to act, do everything possible to go further.

#GOPdebate translation: Doubling down on trickle-down economics. 

America needs an economy that works for everyone.
For 35 years, Republicans have argued that more wealth at the top will trickle down‚Äîand twice, a Democrat has had to clean up the mess.
Republicans who want to repeal the ACA should try telling that to the 18 million people who have health coverage because of it. #GOPdebate

"Efforts to establish a modern joint training center are being held up by Congress. The men and women who serve our country deserve better."

"I pledged that...every one [of the Accountability Review Board's recommendations] would be on the way to implementation. And they were."
"We have a responsibility to provide diplomats with the resources &amp; support they need to do their jobs as safely &amp; effectively as possible."
Hillary on fallen Americans in Libya: "They believed‚Äîas I do‚Äîthat America is greatest force for peace &amp; progress the world has ever known."

We‚Äôre grateful for supportive teachers. In junior high, his PE teacher called &amp; asked if Adam would go for cross country.
Through Adam, we informally raise awareness for people with disabilities every day: It's as simple as taking pride in the small things.
One thing that concerns us as Adam gets older is what happens after he finishes school.

"I‚Äôm running for President to build an America for tomorrow, not yesterday‚Äîwhere if you do your part, you will reap the rewards."‚ÄîHillary
"Above all, we have to break out of the poisonous partisan gridlock and focus on the long-term needs of our country."
"Let's get back to making decisions that rely on evidence more than ideology."
"I will appoint and empower regulators who understand that Too Big To Fail is still too big a problem."
"I will offer plans to rein in excessive risk on Wall Street and ensure that stock markets work for everyday investors."
"Too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences...This is wrong‚Äî&amp; on my watch, it will change."
Hillary on misconduct in the financial industry: "There can be no justification or tolerance for this kind of criminal behavior."
"Workers are assets. Investing in them pays off. Higher wages pay off. And training pays off."
"Too many pressures in our economy today are pushing us toward short-termism." http://t.co/AgJQAOjBB9
"The third key driver of income gains alongside strong growth and fair growth must be long-term growth." http://t.co/3wz5pKFic7
"When all Americans have the chance to study hard, work hard, and share in our country‚Äôs prosperity‚Äîthat‚Äôs fair growth."
"To create fair growth, we need to create opportunity for more Americans." http://t.co/zt177GbuwG
"If we want to get serious about raising incomes, we have to get serious about supporting union workers."
"I will propose ways to encourage companies to share profits with their employees. That's good for workers, and good for businesses."
"To get all incomes rising again, we need to strike a better balance. If you work hard, you ought to be paid fairly."
"Let him tell that to the fast food workers marching in the streets for better pay.

They don‚Äôt need a lecture‚Äîthey need a raise."
"You may have heard Gov. Bush say last week that Americans just need to work longer hours. He must not have met very many American workers."
"The evidence is in: Inequality is a drag on our entire economy. This is the problem we need to tackle." http://t.co/Q6Bbhwbtb6
"As President, I‚Äôll fight to put families first‚Äîjust like I have my entire career."
"For far too long, these challenges have been dismissed by some as 'women‚Äôs issues.' Well, those days are over."
"It‚Äôs way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job‚Äîand women of color making even less."
"It‚Äôs time to recognize that quality, affordable child care is not a luxury‚Äîit‚Äôs a growth strategy."
"When we leave people out, or write them off, we not only shortchange them‚Äîwe shortchange our country and shortchange our future."
"We can‚Äôt afford to leave talent on the sidelines." http://t.co/wD2Bm5iA3e
Another key to strong growth that often goes overlooked &amp; undervalued: Breaking down barriers to joining the workforce‚Äîespecially for women.
"There‚Äôs no excuse not to make greater investments in cleaner, renewable energy right now."
"Bringing millions of hard-working people into the formal economy would increase our GDP by an estimated $700 billion over 10 years."
"I know it‚Äôs not always how we think about this, but another engine of strong growth should be comprehensive immigration reform."
"More growth means more jobs and more new businesses." http://t.co/Fl4eGGalIW
"Today I am proposing an agenda to raise incomes for hard-working Americans. An agenda for strong growth, fair growth, &amp; long-term growth."
"I want to see our economy work for the struggling, the striving, and the successful." http://t.co/zfZSkwCzYg
"The measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for hard-working families‚Äînot just for successful CEOs and money managers."
"As President, I will work with every possible partner to turn the tide‚Äîto make these currents of change start working for us."
"[Changes in our economy] don‚Äôt determine our destiny. The choices we make as a nation matter."
"The defining economic challenge of our time is clear: We must raise incomes for hard-working Americans." http://t.co/nt3xYtbMSd
Wages need to rise to keep up with costs. Paychecks need to grow. Families who work hard &amp; do their part deserve to get ahead &amp; stay ahead.
"I believe we have to build a 'growth and fairness' economy. You can‚Äôt have one without the other."
We can‚Äôt go back to the old policies that failed us before. http://t.co/HtNAREtpsZ
"For 35 years, Republicans have argued that if we give more wealth to those at the top...it will trickle down to everyone else."
"That bargain has eroded. Our job is to make it strong again." http://t.co/T3ARkHJRsz
"If you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead. And when you get ahead, America gets ahead."
"I‚Äôve had the opportunity to listen to Americans‚Äô concerns about an economy that still isn‚Äôt delivering for them the way it should."‚ÄîHillary
